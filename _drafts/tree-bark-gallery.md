It would be awesome to have really high quality photos of Australian tree trunks/bark, especially eucalypts. Their bark is super sweet and beautiful, and incredibly varied. I'd like it in an online gallery where you could click thru and see the names of the species. I have an idea that it's hard to ID gum trees, tho that's based on nothing. I haven't tried looking up how to do that, or getting a book yet.
