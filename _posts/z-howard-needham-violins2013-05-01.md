Howard Needham, a luthier based in Silver Spring, Maryland, needed an update to his old Flash-based site that would be structured to modern web standards. My site design puts the focus where it should be: on his beautiful instruments.<!--more-->

Howard needed a site that would play nice with search engines, and be accessible to all sorts of devices. It also needed to convey the weight of old-world violin artistry and high-end quality without feeling stodgy. I created an image-based responsive experience for Howard and his customers that allows people to browse his technique and instrument styles easily.
