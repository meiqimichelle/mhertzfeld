The NOAA Satellite and Information Service's (NESDIS) International and Interagency Affairs Division (IIAD) needed a new website. Really, they needed a modern strategy for communicating with its customers online.<!--more-->

The website redesign process involved research into who was already coming to the NESDIS IIAD website and their needs, as well as discussion within NESDIS IIAD to set goals for digital outreach in the future. In particular, my work focused on a new information architecture for the website that would speak to different audiences and clearly lead each to the needed information.

This website work was later complemented with an [outreach campaign](/work/noaa-iiad-coms/).
