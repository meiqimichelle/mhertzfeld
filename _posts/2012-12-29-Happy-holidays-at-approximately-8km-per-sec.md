Now that the holidays are over, I'd like to share the illustration I did for our office annual holiday email -- I'm very pleased with it! I should mention I work in international affairs for a satellite office. I was going for 'holidays' without a specific religion or world region focus. Also tried to come up with something not too overdone. And so we have: bird's-eye view of an abstract world with a stylized aurora!<!--more-->

I especially like that the Suomi-NPP satellite is recognizable. Well, recognizable to the small percentage of the population that looks at satellite bodies on a regular basis :) See?

PS: Curious about the 8km/sec? That is the [approximate speed of a satellite in low-Earth orbit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed#Earth_orbits) as it zooms around the globe. ::WHOOSH!::
