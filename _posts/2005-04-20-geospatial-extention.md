I worked at the Arizona Remote Sensing Center making online mapping tools to aid land management and helping run outreach programs for ranchers and public agency personnel to learn how to use them.<!--more-->

One of the major projects of while working at the [Arizona Remote Sensing Center](http://www.portal.environment.arizona.edu/centers-and-institutes/arizona-remote-sensing-center-arsc) was the development of a resource sharing site for members of the National Geospatial Technology Extension Network and their customers. I worked on the design, branding and front-end development of a Drupal framework that served Geospatial Extension Specialists at land-grant universities across the country.
