The NOAA Satellite and Information Service (NESDIS) had a problem: no one knew that it flew satellites! ("Satellites? Isn't that NASA?") I worked with an internal NOAA-NESDIS team to strategize better outreach methods that told the NOAA-NESDIS story proactively, rather than reactively.<!--more-->

As part of this process, one problem identified was that NESDIS did not have a succinct document with go-to information on common questions such as satellite development status and current NOAA budget status. I worked with a communications team member to research what would comprise such common information, and then designed and wrote copy for a back-to-front newsletter that could be easily updated and published twice-yearly. "The Downlink" is now shared both in print and online. [See "The Downlink," Issue 1, here](https://meiqimichelle.github.io/mhertzfeld/assets/docs/TheDownlink_Issue1_Spring2013_NOAA_NESDIS_IIAD.pdf).

Another part of this communications strategy work was to better understand the NOAA-NESDIS customer. I started by consolidating and organizing NESDIS International and Interagency Affairs mass emailing to MailChimp to take advantage of its advanced list management features. I also provided the design and illustration for the NOAA-NESDIS International and Interagency Affairs Division's first outreach email campaign that advertised its [new website]({{ site.baseurl }}/work/noaa-iiad-web/).
