Take a [look a the latest](http://www.nihsail.org/) -- we're getting there! It was quite an adventure, working on making more robust Wordpress functionality than I've needed to in the past.<!--more-->

In the end, I am fairly pleased with the result. The challenge is still in those finishing details that take a site from functional and nice, to absolutely beautiful. I still find that with Wordpress, making those final changes is tough for me -- tracking down the code to move that title to *just* where it should be at midnight after you've worked out all the bigger problems is hard to do!

Also, at this point I don't have enough time to force Wordpress to be responsive. The site needs to be functional for the 2013 sailing season so members can register. ::sad face::
