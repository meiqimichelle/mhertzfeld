Ronét Jewelry is a growing small business based in Silver Spring, Maryland that wanted to expand to online sales. Online sales meant Ronét needed a website!<!--more-->

Renee Tatusko designs and creates handmade jewelry pieces and sells them all over the world. In order to continue expanding her business, she needed an e-commerce solution that would allow her to **easily maintain the online store on her own**, and also allow me to **customize the site to match her unique style** and create a brand. Of course, since more and more online shopping happens through mobile devices, the site needed to be responsive.

This site was built on [BigCartel's](http://bigcartel.com/) solid e-commerce solution. Their administrative system is simple and easy for Renee to use, and their default storefronts are built with modern web standards. I was also able to customize the design to my heart's content with little time needed to get up and running, and I was able to adjust almost everything the BigCartel system to meet my customer's needs.
