"But why," I ask myself, "why should I use systems built by very smart people to suit a wide variety of website needs when I can spend time and energy making my own from scratch?" Why indeed.<!--more-->

I've decided to take my understanding of how The Interwebz works to a new level. This thing called GitHub has always been "that strange place with the phallic logo that programmers wax poetic about." Lately, [several](http://www.kinlane.com) [people](#) have been convincing me of the potential of GitHub to do lots of cool stuff (like make [government policy more open and accessible](http://project-open-data.github.io), for example, but taking the programmer framework of versioning and forking and contributing, and expanding it to new fields).

Yeah, ok. But GitHub is still a non-programmer usability nightmare. Is it all online, or is this something I have to command line? (answer: both online and computer GUI or command) How the hell do I **upload** something? (answer: you can't. you have to use that command line or computer GUI to 'upload' files)(long story).

But, money where your mouth is, right? I need to update my personal website anyways, so let's effing bleeding edge it, eh?
