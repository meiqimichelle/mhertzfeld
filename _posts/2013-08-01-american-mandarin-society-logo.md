The American Mandarin Society is a new organization composed of a younger generation of Mandarin scholars who have studied, researched and lived in Greater China. It needed a mark that would reflect its scholarly background, but also point to the group's modern, youthful focus.<!--more-->

The [American Mandarin Society](http://www.mandarinsociety.us/) (AMS) came to me with traditional imagery of the Chinese scholar. Cranes were once the mark of those who had passed the rigorous tests to become a government official in imperial China. AMS hoped to use this symbolism in their branding, but at the same time wanted a modern, clean look that would represent their younger constituency.

This logo uses the imagery of the red-crowned crane drawn in a style that invokes traditional Chinese brush painting with a modern twist. The type treatment is a juxtoposition of the traditional top-down, right-left Chinese character placement alongside a sans-serif English title.
